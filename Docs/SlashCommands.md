## Command Registry

`SlashRegistry.js` provides:

- `listCommands()` — Returns all command definitions
- `getModeInstruction(modeId)` — Loads mode prompt from `Prompts/Modes/<id>.md`

---

## Adding a New Command

Add one entry to `COMMANDS` in `Commands.js`:

```js
{
  id: 'my-command',
  label: 'My Command',
  description: 'What it does.',
  type: 'action',  // or 'mode' or 'navigate'
  icon: 'info',
  action: 'handlerKey',  // for action type
}
```

No other file needs to change — the registry auto-discovers commands.

---

## UI

`SlashCommandsPanel.js` displays available commands in a palette when the user types `/` in the chat input. Commands are filtered by the typed text.
