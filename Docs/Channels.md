## Channel Configuration

Channel state is stored in `Data/Channels.json`:

```json
{
  "channels": {
    "telegram": {
      "enabled": true,
      "credentials": {
        "botToken": "..."
      },
      "systemPrompt": "Optional channel-specific prompt"
    },
    "discord": {
      "enabled": false,
      "credentials": {
        "botToken": "..."
      }
    }
  }
}
```

---

## Channel Runtime

`ChannelRuntime.js` manages:

- **Polling**: Periodic message polling for channels that don't support webhooks
- **Validation**: Credential verification per channel type
- **Reply dispatch**: Sending AI responses back to channels

### Reply Flow

```text
External message received
    ↓
ChannelRuntime polls or receives webhook
    ↓
Message passed to AssistantPipeline
    ↓
AI generates response
    ↓
ChannelRuntime sends reply via channel API
    ↓
Message saved to ChannelMessages
```

---

## Shared Assistant Pipeline

Channels use the same `AssistantPipeline` as Chat:

```js
// Packages/Shared/AssistantRuntime/AssistantPipeline.js
const pipeline = new AssistantPipeline();
const response = await pipeline.execute({
  messages: [...],
  persona: activePersona,
  memory: memoryContext,
  tools: toolDefinitions,
  // ...
});
```

This ensures external channel replies use the same prompt/context assembly and bounded tool loop as chat.

---

## Channel-Specific System Prompts

Each channel can have its own system prompt. This is stored in the channel configuration and included in the AI's context when processing messages from that channel.

---

## Channel Messages

Messages are stored in `Data/ChannelMessages/` for history and reference.

---

## Channel Validation

`channels:validate` checks credentials per channel type:

- Telegram: Verify bot token
- WhatsApp: Verify Twilio accountSid and auth token
- Discord: Verify bot token and channel ID
- Slack: Verify bot token and channel ID
- Zulip: Verify site URL, bot email, API key, and stream
- Mattermost: Verify site URL, access token, and channel ID
- ntfy: Verify site URL and topic

---

## Channel Icons

`channels:icon-paths` returns file paths for channel icons used in the UI.

---

## Enabling/Disabling Channels

`channels:toggle` enables or disables a channel:

- Enabled: Channel starts polling/webhook
- Disabled: Channel stops polling/webhook
